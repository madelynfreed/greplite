I'm sad today, mostly because he didn't wake me up with something nice, or checking how i was. instead he just told me that he couldn't go swimming. he bothers me with these small worries. that don't really come ture they just serve to make the present moment a little more anxious. and now he's not testing me back. he's probably at standup but i just want him to text me back. now i'm pretty sure this weekend will be stressful i am so anxious i am so sad.
