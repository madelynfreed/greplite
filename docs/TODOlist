Here's what I have to do OK?
*simplify the bin file so you just call one function
*tab complete for vim
*persistent undo
*
*write a test testing the bin file using a subprocess (how to excecute subprocess from python)

* have a switch that searches through all files

* represent those entries in a pretty way
*README
* get up onto github
* list of tests
* refactor for list comprehensions
* maybe figure out a way to look through files without opening and reading them? seems to be kind of fragile
* AND search
