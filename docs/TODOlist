Here's what I have to do OK?

* be able to create a /.logfind file that is referenced as the type of files to look through
* be able to look through a type of file by regex 
* figure out how to look for a ~/.logfind file upon installation. put it in the path of the setup? of the bin file?
* represent those entries in a pretty way
*README
* get up onto github
* list of tests
